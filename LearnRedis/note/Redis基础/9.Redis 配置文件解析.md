# 1. Redis 指定启动配置
```
# Redis configuration file example.
#
# Note that in order to read the configuration file, Redis must be
# started with the file path as first argument:
#
# ./redis-server /path/to/redis.conf
```
启动时未指定启动配置，将使用默认配置文件启动；如果指定了启动配置，则使用指定的配置文件启动。

> [Redis 默认配置：http://download.redis.io/redis-stable/redis.conf](http://download.redis.io/redis-stable/redis.conf)

# 2. UNITS
```
# Note on units: when memory size is needed, it is possible to specify
# it in the usual form of 1k 5GB 4M and so forth:
#
# 1k => 1000 bytes
# 1kb => 1024 bytes
# 1m => 1000000 bytes
# 1mb => 1024*1024 bytes
# 1g => 1000000000 bytes
# 1gb => 1024*1024*1024 bytes
#
# units are case insensitive so 1GB 1Gb 1gB are all the same.
```
- 定义一些基本的度量单位，只支持 bytes，不支持 bit
- 大小写不敏感
- 注意 k 和 kb 之间的差异

# 3. INCLUDES
```
################################## INCLUDES ###################################

# Include one or more other config files here.  This is useful if you
# have a standard template that goes to all Redis servers but also need
# to customize a few per-server settings.  Include files can include
# other files, so use this wisely.
#
# Notice option "include" won't be rewritten by command "CONFIG REWRITE"
# from admin or Redis Sentinel. Since Redis always uses the last processed
# line as value of a configuration directive, you'd better put includes
# at the beginning of this file to avoid overwriting config change at runtime.
#
# If instead you are interested in using includes to override configuration
# options, it is better to use include as the last line.
#
# include /path/to/local.conf
# include /path/to/other.conf
```
类似于 springboot 中的 application.yml 和 application-dev.yml 关系，公共配置放在总的配置文件中，某些个性化配置在自定义配置中，通过 include 引入即可。

> 需要注意，如果将此配置写在 redis.conf 文件的开头，那后面的配置会覆盖引入文件的配置，如果想以引入文件的配置为主，那么需要将 include 配置写在 redis.conf 文件的末尾。

# 4. MODULES
```
################################## MODULES #####################################

# Load modules at startup. If the server is not able to load modules
# it will abort. It is possible to use multiple loadmodule directives.
#
# loadmodule /path/to/my_module.so
# loadmodule /path/to/other_module.so
```

# 5. NETWORK
> 配置文件中，第 46 - 130 行，内容较多，简要展示
```
################################## NETWORK #####################################

bind 127.0.0.1

# Protected mode is a layer of security protection, in order to avoid that
# Redis instances left open on the internet are accessed and exploited.
protected-mode yes

# Accept connections on the specified port, default is 6379 (IANA #815344).
# If port 0 is specified Redis will not listen on a TCP socket.
port 6379

# TCP listen() backlog.
tcp-backlog 511

# Close the connection after a client is idle for N seconds (0 to disable)
timeout 0

# TCP keepalive.
tcp-keepalive 300
```
- bind:绑定redis服务器网卡IP，默认为127.0.0.1,即本地回环地址。这样的话，访问redis服务只能通过本机的客户端连接，而无法通过远程连接。如果bind选项为空的话，那会接受所有来自于可用网络接口的连接。
- protected-mode：保护模式，默认是开启状态，只允许本地客户端连接， 可以设置密码或添加bind来连接
- port：指定redis运行的端口，默认是6379。由于Redis是单线程模型，因此单机开多个Redis进程的时候会修改端口。
- tcp-backlog：TCP监听的最大容纳数量，在高并发的环境下，你需要把这个值调高以避免客户端连接缓慢的问题。Linux 内核会把这个值缩小成 /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn对应的值，要提升并发量需要修改这两个值才能达到目的
- timeout：设置客户端连接时的超时时间，单位为秒。当客户端在这段时间内没有发出任何指令，那么关闭该连接。默认值为0，表示不关闭。
- tcp-keepalive ：单位是秒，表示将周期性的使用SO_KEEPALIVE检测客户端是否还处于健康状态，避免服务器一直阻塞，官方给出的建议值是300s，如果设置为0，则不会周期性的检测。

# 6. GENERAL
> 配置文件中，第 132 - 194 行，内容较多，简要展示
```
################################# GENERAL #####################################

daemonize no

supervised no

pidfile /var/run/redis_6379.pid

loglevel notice

logfile ""

databases 16

always-show-logo yes
```
- daemonize:设置为yes表示指定Redis以守护进程的方式启动（后台启动）。默认值为 no
- pidfile:配置PID文件路径，当redis作为守护进程运行的时候，它会把 pid 默认写到 /var/redis/run/redis_6379.pid 文件里面
- loglevel ：定义日志级别。默认值为notice，有如下4种取值：
    - debug（记录大量日志信息，适用于开发、测试阶段）
    - verbose（较多日志信息）
    - notice（适量日志信息，使用于生产环境）
    - warning（仅有部分重要、关键信息才会被记录）
- logfile ：配置log文件地址,默认打印在命令行终端的窗口上
- databases：设置数据库的数目。默认的数据库是DB 0 ，可以在每个连接上使用select  <dbid> 命令选择一个不同的数据库，dbid是一个介于0到databases - 1 之间的数值。默认值是 16，也就是说默认Redis有16个数据库。

# 7. SNAPSHOTTING
```
################################ SNAPSHOTTING  ################################
#
# Save the DB on disk:
#
#   save <seconds> <changes>
#
#   Will save the DB if both the given number of seconds and the given
#   number of write operations against the DB occurred.
#
#   In the example below the behaviour will be to save:
#   after 900 sec (15 min) if at least 1 key changed
#   after 300 sec (5 min) if at least 10 keys changed
#   after 60 sec if at least 10000 keys changed
#
#   Note: you can disable saving completely by commenting out all "save" lines.
#
#   It is also possible to remove all the previously configured save
#   points by adding a save directive with a single empty string argument
#   like in the following example:
#
#   save ""

save 900 1
save 300 10
save 60 10000
```
save：这里是用来配置触发 Redis的持久化条件，也就是什么时候将内存中的数据保存到硬盘。（如果仅仅使用缓存功能，不需要持久化，那么你可以注释掉所有的 save 行来停用保存功能。可以直接一个空字符串来实现停用：save ""）默认如下配置：
    - save 900 1：表示900 秒内如果至少有 1 个 key 的值变化，则保存
    - save 300 10：表示300 秒内如果至少有 10 个 key 的值变化，则保存
    - save 60 10000：表示60 秒内如果至少有 10000 个 key 的值变化，则保存


```
# By default Redis will stop accepting writes if RDB snapshots are enabled
# (at least one save point) and the latest background save failed.
# This will make the user aware (in a hard way) that data is not persisting
# on disk properly, otherwise chances are that no one will notice and some
# disaster will happen.
#
# If the background saving process will start working again Redis will
# automatically allow writes again.
#
# However if you have setup your proper monitoring of the Redis server
# and persistence, you may want to disable this feature so that Redis will
# continue to work as usual even if there are problems with disk,
# permissions, and so forth.
stop-writes-on-bgsave-error yes

# Compress string objects using LZF when dump .rdb databases?
# For default that's set to 'yes' as it's almost always a win.
# If you want to save some CPU in the saving child set it to 'no' but
# the dataset will likely be bigger if you have compressible values or keys.
rdbcompression yes

# Since version 5 of RDB a CRC64 checksum is placed at the end of the file.
# This makes the format more resistant to corruption but there is a performance
# hit to pay (around 10%) when saving and loading RDB files, so you can disable it
# for maximum performances.
#
# RDB files created with checksum disabled have a checksum of zero that will
# tell the loading code to skip the check.
rdbchecksum yes

# The filename where to dump the DB
dbfilename dump.rdb

# The working directory.
#
# The DB will be written inside this directory, with the filename specified
# above using the 'dbfilename' configuration directive.
#
# The Append Only File will also be created inside this directory.
#
# Note that you must specify a directory here, not a file name.
dir ./
```

- stop-writes-on-bgsave-error ：默认值为yes。当启用了RDB且最后一次后台保存数据失败，Redis是否停止接收数据。这会让用户意识到数据没有正确持久化到磁盘上，否则没有人会注意到灾难（disaster）发生了。如果Redis重启了，那么又可以重新开始接收数据了。
- rdbcompression ；默认值是yes。对于存储到磁盘中的快照，可以设置是否进行压缩存储。如果是的话，redis会采用LZF算法进行压缩。如果你不想消耗CPU来进行压缩的话，可以设置为关闭此功能，但是存储在磁盘上的快照会比较大。
- rdbchecksum ：默认值是yes。在存储快照后，我们还可以让redis使用CRC64算法来进行数据校验，但是这样做会增加大约10%的性能消耗，如果希望获取到最大的性能提升，可以关闭此功能。
- dbfilename ：设置快照的文件名，默认是 dump.rdb。
- dir：设置快照文件的存放路径，这个配置项一定是个目录，而不能是文件名。使用上面的 dbfilename 作为保存的文件名。

# 8. REPLICATION
```

################################# REPLICATION #################################

# Master-Replica replication. Use replicaof to make a Redis instance a copy of
# another Redis server. A few things to understand ASAP about Redis replication.
#
#   +------------------+      +---------------+
#   |      Master      | ---> |    Replica    |
#   | (receive writes) |      |  (exact copy) |
#   +------------------+      +---------------+
#
# 1) Redis replication is asynchronous, but you can configure a master to
#    stop accepting writes if it appears to be not connected with at least
#    a given number of replicas.
# 2) Redis replicas are able to perform a partial resynchronization with the
#    master if the replication link is lost for a relatively small amount of
#    time. You may want to configure the replication backlog size (see the next
#    sections of this file) with a sensible value depending on your needs.
# 3) Replication is automatic and does not need user intervention. After a
#    network partition replicas automatically try to reconnect to masters
#    and resynchronize with them.
#
# replicaof <masterip> <masterport>

# If the master is password protected (using the "requirepass" configuration
# directive below) it is possible to tell the replica to authenticate before
# starting the replication synchronization process, otherwise the master will
# refuse the replica request.
#
# masterauth <master-password>

# When a replica loses its connection with the master, or when the replication
# is still in progress, the replica can act in two different ways:
#
# 1) if replica-serve-stale-data is set to 'yes' (the default) the replica will
#    still reply to client requests, possibly with out of date data, or the
#    data set may just be empty if this is the first synchronization.
#
# 2) if replica-serve-stale-data is set to 'no' the replica will reply with
#    an error "SYNC with master in progress" to all the kind of commands
#    but to INFO, replicaOF, AUTH, PING, SHUTDOWN, REPLCONF, ROLE, CONFIG,
#    SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE, PSUBSCRIBE, PUNSUBSCRIBE, PUBLISH, PUBSUB,
#    COMMAND, POST, HOST: and LATENCY.
#
replica-serve-stale-data yes

# You can configure a replica instance to accept writes or not. Writing against
# a replica instance may be useful to store some ephemeral data (because data
# written on a replica will be easily deleted after resync with the master) but
# may also cause problems if clients are writing to it because of a
# misconfiguration.
#
# Since Redis 2.6 by default replicas are read-only.
#
# Note: read only replicas are not designed to be exposed to untrusted clients
# on the internet. It's just a protection layer against misuse of the instance.
# Still a read only replica exports by default all the administrative commands
# such as CONFIG, DEBUG, and so forth. To a limited extent you can improve
# security of read only replicas using 'rename-command' to shadow all the
# administrative / dangerous commands.
replica-read-only yes

# Replication SYNC strategy: disk or socket.
#
# -------------------------------------------------------
# WARNING: DISKLESS REPLICATION IS EXPERIMENTAL CURRENTLY
# -------------------------------------------------------
#
# New replicas and reconnecting replicas that are not able to continue the replication
# process just receiving differences, need to do what is called a "full
# synchronization". An RDB file is transmitted from the master to the replicas.
# The transmission can happen in two different ways:
#
# 1) Disk-backed: The Redis master creates a new process that writes the RDB
#                 file on disk. Later the file is transferred by the parent
#                 process to the replicas incrementally.
# 2) Diskless: The Redis master creates a new process that directly writes the
#              RDB file to replica sockets, without touching the disk at all.
#
# With disk-backed replication, while the RDB file is generated, more replicas
# can be queued and served with the RDB file as soon as the current child producing
# the RDB file finishes its work. With diskless replication instead once
# the transfer starts, new replicas arriving will be queued and a new transfer
# will start when the current one terminates.
#
# When diskless replication is used, the master waits a configurable amount of
# time (in seconds) before starting the transfer in the hope that multiple replicas
# will arrive and the transfer can be parallelized.
#
# With slow disks and fast (large bandwidth) networks, diskless replication
# works better.
repl-diskless-sync no

# When diskless replication is enabled, it is possible to configure the delay
# the server waits in order to spawn the child that transfers the RDB via socket
# to the replicas.
#
# This is important since once the transfer starts, it is not possible to serve
# new replicas arriving, that will be queued for the next RDB transfer, so the server
# waits a delay in order to let more replicas arrive.
#
# The delay is specified in seconds, and by default is 5 seconds. To disable
# it entirely just set it to 0 seconds and the transfer will start ASAP.
repl-diskless-sync-delay 5

# Replicas send PINGs to server in a predefined interval. It's possible to change
# this interval with the repl_ping_replica_period option. The default value is 10
# seconds.
#
# repl-ping-replica-period 10

# The following option sets the replication timeout for:
#
# 1) Bulk transfer I/O during SYNC, from the point of view of replica.
# 2) Master timeout from the point of view of replicas (data, pings).
# 3) Replica timeout from the point of view of masters (REPLCONF ACK pings).
#
# It is important to make sure that this value is greater than the value
# specified for repl-ping-replica-period otherwise a timeout will be detected
# every time there is low traffic between the master and the replica.
#
# repl-timeout 60

# Disable TCP_NODELAY on the replica socket after SYNC?
#
# If you select "yes" Redis will use a smaller number of TCP packets and
# less bandwidth to send data to replicas. But this can add a delay for
# the data to appear on the replica side, up to 40 milliseconds with
# Linux kernels using a default configuration.
#
# If you select "no" the delay for data to appear on the replica side will
# be reduced but more bandwidth will be used for replication.
#
# By default we optimize for low latency, but in very high traffic conditions
# or when the master and replicas are many hops away, turning this to "yes" may
# be a good idea.
repl-disable-tcp-nodelay no

# Set the replication backlog size. The backlog is a buffer that accumulates
# replica data when replicas are disconnected for some time, so that when a replica
# wants to reconnect again, often a full resync is not needed, but a partial
# resync is enough, just passing the portion of data the replica missed while
# disconnected.
#
# The bigger the replication backlog, the longer the time the replica can be
# disconnected and later be able to perform a partial resynchronization.
#
# The backlog is only allocated once there is at least a replica connected.
#
# repl-backlog-size 1mb

# After a master has no longer connected replicas for some time, the backlog
# will be freed. The following option configures the amount of seconds that
# need to elapse, starting from the time the last replica disconnected, for
# the backlog buffer to be freed.
#
# Note that replicas never free the backlog for timeout, since they may be
# promoted to masters later, and should be able to correctly "partially
# resynchronize" with the replicas: hence they should always accumulate backlog.
#
# A value of 0 means to never release the backlog.
#
# repl-backlog-ttl 3600

# The replica priority is an integer number published by Redis in the INFO output.
# It is used by Redis Sentinel in order to select a replica to promote into a
# master if the master is no longer working correctly.
#
# A replica with a low priority number is considered better for promotion, so
# for instance if there are three replicas with priority 10, 100, 25 Sentinel will
# pick the one with priority 10, that is the lowest.
#
# However a special priority of 0 marks the replica as not able to perform the
# role of master, so a replica with priority of 0 will never be selected by
# Redis Sentinel for promotion.
#
# By default the priority is 100.
replica-priority 100

# It is possible for a master to stop accepting writes if there are less than
# N replicas connected, having a lag less or equal than M seconds.
#
# The N replicas need to be in "online" state.
#
# The lag in seconds, that must be <= the specified value, is calculated from
# the last ping received from the replica, that is usually sent every second.
#
# This option does not GUARANTEE that N replicas will accept the write, but
# will limit the window of exposure for lost writes in case not enough replicas
# are available, to the specified number of seconds.
#
# For example to require at least 3 replicas with a lag <= 10 seconds use:
#
# min-replicas-to-write 3
# min-replicas-max-lag 10
#
# Setting one or the other to 0 disables the feature.
#
# By default min-replicas-to-write is set to 0 (feature disabled) and
# min-replicas-max-lag is set to 10.

# A Redis master is able to list the address and port of the attached
# replicas in different ways. For example the "INFO replication" section
# offers this information, which is used, among other tools, by
# Redis Sentinel in order to discover replica instances.
# Another place where this info is available is in the output of the
# "ROLE" command of a master.
#
# The listed IP and address normally reported by a replica is obtained
# in the following way:
#
#   IP: The address is auto detected by checking the peer address
#   of the socket used by the replica to connect with the master.
#
#   Port: The port is communicated by the replica during the replication
#   handshake, and is normally the port that the replica is using to
#   listen for connections.
#
# However when port forwarding or Network Address Translation (NAT) is
# used, the replica may be actually reachable via different IP and port
# pairs. The following two options can be used by a replica in order to
# report to its master a specific set of IP and port, so that both INFO
# and ROLE will report those values.
#
# There is no need to use both the options if you need to override just
# the port or the IP address.
#
# replica-announce-ip 5.5.5.5
# replica-announce-port 1234
```

# 9.APPEND ONLY MODE
```
############################## APPEND ONLY MODE ###############################

# By default Redis asynchronously dumps the dataset on disk. This mode is
# good enough in many applications, but an issue with the Redis process or
# a power outage may result into a few minutes of writes lost (depending on
# the configured save points).
#
# The Append Only File is an alternative persistence mode that provides
# much better durability. For instance using the default data fsync policy
# (see later in the config file) Redis can lose just one second of writes in a
# dramatic event like a server power outage, or a single write if something
# wrong with the Redis process itself happens, but the operating system is
# still running correctly.
#
# AOF and RDB persistence can be enabled at the same time without problems.
# If the AOF is enabled on startup Redis will load the AOF, that is the file
# with the better durability guarantees.
#
# Please check http://redis.io/topics/persistence for more information.

appendonly no

```
appendonly：默认redis使用的是rdb方式持久化，这种方式在许多应用中已经足够用了。但是redis如果中途宕机，会导致可能有几分钟的数据丢失，根据save来策略进行持久化，Append Only File是另一种持久化方式，  可以提供更好的持久化特性。Redis会把每次写入的数据在接收后都写入appendonly.aof文件，每次启动时Redis都会先把这个文件的数据读入内存里，先忽略RDB文件。默认值为no。

```
# The name of the append only file (default: "appendonly.aof")

appendfilename "appendonly.aof"

```
appendfilename ：aof文件名，默认是"appendonly.aof"

```
# The fsync() call tells the Operating System to actually write data on disk
# instead of waiting for more data in the output buffer. Some OS will really flush
# data on disk, some other OS will just try to do it ASAP.
#
# Redis supports three different modes:
#
# no: don't fsync, just let the OS flush the data when it wants. Faster.
# always: fsync after every write to the append only log. Slow, Safest.
# everysec: fsync only one time every second. Compromise.
#
# The default is "everysec", as that's usually the right compromise between
# speed and data safety. It's up to you to understand if you can relax this to
# "no" that will let the operating system flush the output buffer when
# it wants, for better performances (but if you can live with the idea of
# some data loss consider the default persistence mode that's snapshotting),
# or on the contrary, use "always" that's very slow but a bit safer than
# everysec.
#
# More details please check the following article:
# http://antirez.com/post/redis-persistence-demystified.html
#
# If unsure, use "everysec".

# appendfsync always
appendfsync everysec
# appendfsync no
```
appendfsync：aof持久化策略的配置；no表示不执行fsync，由操作系统保证数据同步到磁盘，速度最快；always表示每次写入都执行fsync，以保证数据同步到磁盘；everysec表示每秒执行一次fsync，可能会导致丢失这1s数据

```
# When the AOF fsync policy is set to always or everysec, and a background
# saving process (a background save or AOF log background rewriting) is
# performing a lot of I/O against the disk, in some Linux configurations
# Redis may block too long on the fsync() call. Note that there is no fix for
# this currently, as even performing fsync in a different thread will block
# our synchronous write(2) call.
#
# In order to mitigate this problem it's possible to use the following option
# that will prevent fsync() from being called in the main process while a
# BGSAVE or BGREWRITEAOF is in progress.
#
# This means that while another child is saving, the durability of Redis is
# the same as "appendfsync none". In practical terms, this means that it is
# possible to lose up to 30 seconds of log in the worst scenario (with the
# default Linux settings).
#
# If you have latency problems turn this to "yes". Otherwise leave it as
# "no" that is the safest pick from the point of view of durability.

no-appendfsync-on-rewrite no
```
no-appendfsync-on-rewrite：在aof重写或者写入rdb文件的时候，会执行大量IO，此时对于everysec和always的aof模式来说，执行fsync会造成阻塞过长时间，no-appendfsync-on-rewrite字段设置为默认设置为no。如果对延迟要求很高的应用，这个字段可以设置为yes，否则还是设置为no，这样对持久化特性来说这是更安全的选择。   设置为yes表示rewrite期间对新写操作不fsync,暂时存在内存中,等rewrite完成后再写入，默认为no，建议yes。Linux的默认fsync策略是30秒。可能丢失30秒数据。默认值为no。

```
# Automatic rewrite of the append only file.
# Redis is able to automatically rewrite the log file implicitly calling
# BGREWRITEAOF when the AOF log size grows by the specified percentage.
#
# This is how it works: Redis remembers the size of the AOF file after the
# latest rewrite (if no rewrite has happened since the restart, the size of
# the AOF at startup is used).
#
# This base size is compared to the current size. If the current size is
# bigger than the specified percentage, the rewrite is triggered. Also
# you need to specify a minimal size for the AOF file to be rewritten, this
# is useful to avoid rewriting the AOF file even if the percentage increase
# is reached but it is still pretty small.
#
# Specify a percentage of zero in order to disable the automatic AOF
# rewrite feature.

auto-aof-rewrite-percentage 100
auto-aof-rewrite-min-size 64mb
```
auto-aof-rewrite-percentage：默认值为100。aof自动重写配置，当目前aof文件大小超过上一次重写的aof文件大小的百分之多少进行重写，即当aof文件增长到一定大小的时候，Redis能够调用bgrewriteaof对日志文件进行重写。当前AOF文件大小是上次日志重写得到AOF文件大小的二倍（设置为100）时，自动启动新的日志重写过程。

auto-aof-rewrite-min-size：64mb。设置允许重写的最小aof文件大小，避免了达到约定百分比但尺寸仍然很小的情况还要重写。

```
# An AOF file may be found to be truncated at the end during the Redis
# startup process, when the AOF data gets loaded back into memory.
# This may happen when the system where Redis is running
# crashes, especially when an ext4 filesystem is mounted without the
# data=ordered option (however this can't happen when Redis itself
# crashes or aborts but the operating system still works correctly).
#
# Redis can either exit with an error when this happens, or load as much
# data as possible (the default now) and start if the AOF file is found
# to be truncated at the end. The following option controls this behavior.
#
# If aof-load-truncated is set to yes, a truncated AOF file is loaded and
# the Redis server starts emitting a log to inform the user of the event.
# Otherwise if the option is set to no, the server aborts with an error
# and refuses to start. When the option is set to no, the user requires
# to fix the AOF file using the "redis-check-aof" utility before to restart
# the server.
#
# Note that if the AOF file will be found to be corrupted in the middle
# the server will still exit with an error. This option only applies when
# Redis will try to read more data from the AOF file but not enough bytes
# will be found.
aof-load-truncated yes

# When rewriting the AOF file, Redis is able to use an RDB preamble in the
# AOF file for faster rewrites and recoveries. When this option is turned
# on the rewritten AOF file is composed of two different stanzas:
#
#   [RDB file][AOF tail]
#
# When loading Redis recognizes that the AOF file starts with the "REDIS"
# string and loads the prefixed RDB file, and continues loading the AOF
# tail.
aof-use-rdb-preamble yes
```
aof-load-truncated：aof文件可能在尾部是不完整的，当redis启动的时候，aof文件的数据被载入内存。重启可能发生在redis所在的主机操作系统宕机后，尤其在ext4文件系统没有加上data=ordered选项，出现这种现象 redis宕机或者异常终止不会造成尾部不完整现象，可以选择让redis退出，或者导入尽可能多的数据。如果选择的是yes，当截断的aof文件被导入的时候，会自动发布一个log给客户端然后load。如果是no，用户必须手动redis-check-aof修复AOF文件才可以。默认值为 yes。
